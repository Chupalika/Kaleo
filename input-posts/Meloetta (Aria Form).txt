##EB basics

This is a 200 stages move-based **Psychic** type challenge, that will last for 14 days. Super Effective types you can use against are Ghost, Dark and Bug.

Drop rates are **25/25/25** for all stages.

- Skill 1: Mega Boost++ – Requires 120 PSB to max. Possibly the best skill for beginners, not very reliable but a big boost for slow Psychic megas.
- Skill 2 (SS): Quirky++ – Requires 120 PSB to max. Part of the best Weekend Meowth strategy. Luxury investment.
