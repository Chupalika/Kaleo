##Potential megaevolutions

Pokemon|Description
:-:|:-
**Aggron** / Tyranitar|3 tap mega. Best effect for the competition, good for disruptions and combos. Aggron is SE
Pinsir / Charizard X (Shiny) / Rayquaza (Shiny) / Camerupt|2 tap mega. Good for disruptions and combos
Mawile|SE mega for beginners, the 3 slashes should make blocks more manageable
Steelix/Glalie (Winking)|Block eaters can do a lot of damage, but can't combo well. Steelix is SE
Beedrill|Square tap could be tricky to use even if SE, but can handle some block
Gengar / Gyarados (Shiny) / Mewtwo X (Shiny)|Removes itself. Fast evolution and nice combo effectiveness, but can't handle blocks
Rayquaza|Removes 10 icons that are non-dragon types. Blocks hinder its viability

##Final notes

The preferred choice is of course a 3tapper, with Aggron being SE. If you lack one of them, fallback to 2 tapper. Use another SE mega like Mawile if you are a beginner. Steelix is an acceptable alternative. Beedrill can work too, but is hard to use. All purpose megas like Gengar and Rayquaza have big problems with blocks, so aren't suggested.

Poison status is mandatory, just like a Poison Pact support. Muk is very important because you will start with a lot of blocks and more will be disrupted, making it the most reliable choice. You can add higher variance to the team with a regular double combo booster strategy. Missing those two strategies, you can add Toxapex or a Poison beatstick. If your Poison team is weak, consider a Steel team with neutral TC.

Beginners could struggle even more in this competition, because of the rarity of good anti-Fairy supports and the high amount of blocks present in all phases of the competition.

Using Poison, could be better to skip Disruption Delay to maximize the damage in the first moves and save some coins.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
