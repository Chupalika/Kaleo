##Final notes

With Complexity-1, this is a 3 supports competition, results will be highly effected by RNG.

Self removal megas and tappers are great, the type effectiveness of the mega is totally marginal. Effect and Speed is miles better than the type alone.

If you don't have Mimikyu/Lunala or TC Hoopa (Unbound), you should probably use a full Sinister Power team. Shadow Dance is not as good as it seems, just like neutral TC. Of course, don't use burst skills.

Using Spookify+, could be better to skip Disruption Delay to maximize the damage in the first moves and save some coins.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
