##Final notes

The preferred choice is of course a 3tapper, with Aggron being Neutral. If you lack one of them, fallback to 2 tapper. Otherwise use a SE one, with Gyarados (Shiny) and Gyarados being the best.

Ground stages can be handled with double TC and Kyogre (Primal) is the perfect beatstick since the stage has rocks. Lacking both SE TC, you should rely on a neutral TC and other beatsticks, like Kyogre, Pikachu, Meganium or Ash-Greninja.

If you're using a tapper, try to setup 2 Numels on row 4, after Disruption Pattern No. 5 (refer to Disruptions pic above). This will lead to the next disruption auto combo-ing, progressing to the next disruption cycle immediately.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
