##EB basics

This is a 200 stages move-based **Dark** type challenge, that will last for 14 days. Super Effective types you can use against are Fighting, Fairy and Bug.

Drop rates are **25/25/25** for all stages.

- Skill 1: **Sleep Charm** – Requires 100 PSB to max. Superior skill, sleep works well on Psychic stages.
- Skill 2 (SS): Spookify+ – Requires 120 PSB to max. Don't swap it, Sleep Charm is already good. Also, not being Ghost type, it is worse than Mimikyu.
