##Potential megaevolutions

Pokemon|Description
:-:|:-
**Aggron** / Tyranitar|3 tap mega. Best effect for the competition, good for disruptions and combos
Pinsir / Charizard X (Shiny) / Rayquaza (Shiny) / Camerupt|2 tap mega. Good for disruptions and combos
Rayquaza|Removes 10 icons that are non-dragon types. Too much rocks to shine and could waste the effect on non-supports
Gyarados (Shiny) / Gengar / Mewtwo X (Shiny)|Removes itself. High combo potential, but can't clear bottom-row non-supports. Gyarados (Shiny) is SE

##Final notes

The preferred choice is of course a 3tapper, with Aggron being Neutral. If you lack one of them, fallback to 2 tapper. Otherwise use a SE one, with Gyarados (Shiny) and Gyarados being the best.

Ground stages can be handled with double TC and Kyogre (Primal) is the perfect beatstick since the stage has rocks. Lacking both SE TC, you should rely on a neutral TC and other beatsticks, like Kyogre, Pikachu, Meganium or Ash-Greninja.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
