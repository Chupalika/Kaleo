##EB basics

This is a 300 stages move-based **Dragon** type challenge, that will last for 14 days. Super Effective types you can use against are Dragon, Ice and Fairy.

Drop rates are **25/25/25** for all stages.

- Skill 1: Barrier Bash+ – Requires 120 PSB to max. Outclassed skill, don't even consider raising it.
- Skill 2 (SS): **Typeless Combo** – Requires 150 PSB to max. Probably the best skill in the game. Save a swapper for it and raise the skill as much as possible. If you are an early game player which struggles to go deep in the EB, consider aborting runs without a drop.
