##Competition basics

This is an **Electric** type competition, so the only Super Effective type is **Ground**.

You have 11 moves to do the highest score you can. Take your time to do the best moves you can! For new players to competitions, it's worth it to do at least one full-item run for getting the Manectite! Doing an itemless run to study disruptions is also suggested.

- Mega Start: Grants Mega Evolution starting the stage
- Attack Power ↑: Attack power gets doubled
- **Complexity -1**: Removes your 4th Support Pokemon from play

##Final notes

With Complexity-1, this is a 3 supports competition, results will be highly effected by RNG.

Self removal megas and tappers are great, the type effectiveness of the mega is totally marginal. Effect and Speed is miles better than the type alone.

Since there isn't a SE TC and Ground Forces rates aren't stellar, this competition allow for a lot of different team, which all do pretty well. So combo with whatever you have and don't rely on burst skills.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
