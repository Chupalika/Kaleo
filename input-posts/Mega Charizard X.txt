##Competition basics

This is a **Dragon** type competition, so the Super Effective types that are highly recommended will be **Dragon**, Ice and Fairy.

You have 10 moves to do the highest score you can. Take your time to do the best moves you can! For new players to competitions, it's worth it to do at least one full-item run for getting the Charizardite X! Doing an itemless run to study disruptions is also suggested.

- Disruption Delay: Delays disruptions for half the duration of the stage
- Attack Power ↑: Attack power gets doubled
- **Complexity -1**: Removes your 4th Support Pokemon from play

##Potential megaevolutions

Pokemon|Description
:-:|:-
**Aggron** / Tyranitar|3 tap mega. Good for disruptions and combos, can take time
**Charizard X (Shiny)** / Pinsir / Rayquaza (Shiny) / Camerupt|2 tap mega. Good for disruptions and combos, can take time. Shiny Charizard X is SE and is also pretty fast considering the lack of MS
**Mewtwo X (Shiny)** / Gengar / Gyarados (Shiny)|Removes itself. High combo potential
Beedrill|Good only if you need desperately need a tapper and lack better alternatives
Rayquaza / Latios / Latias / Diancie (Shiny) / Charizard X / Altaria|Other SE megas, acceptable for beginners. For Rayquaza, remember that you can't use a monotype Dragon team

##Final notes

With Complexity-1, this is a 3 supports competition, results will be highly effected by RNG.

Self removal megas and tappers are great, the type effectiveness of the mega is totally marginal. Effect and Speed is miles better than the type alone.

TC Zygarde-50% rules the competition, if you miss it don't use a neutral TC, stick with a full Dancing Dragon team made of Dragonite and Dragonair. Fairy and Ice combo teams are worse, but still better than burst skills.

Absolutely never run Freeze+, because the disruptions are extremely beneficial and could also loop.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
