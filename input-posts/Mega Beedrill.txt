##Competition basics

This is a **Poison** type competition, so the Super Effective types that are highly recommended will be **Ground** and **Psychic**.

You have 9 moves to do the highest score you can. Take your time to do the best moves you can! For new players to competitions, it's worth it to do at least one full-item run for getting the Beedrillite! Doing an itemless run to study disruptions is also suggested.

- Mega Start: Grants Mega Evolution starting the stage
- Attack Power ↑: Attack power gets doubled
- **Complexity -1**: Removes your 4th Support Pokemon from play

##Final notes

With Complexity-1, this is a 3 supports competition, results will be highly effected by RNG.

Self removal megas and tappers are great, the type effectiveness of the mega is totally marginal. Effect and Speed is miles better than the type alone.

Best teams will be Psychic TC with Groudon (Primal) and double Psychic TC. Then follows double/single Ground Forces and the Normal team. If you miss any of them, you should use neutral TC with a SE with high AP. Psychic Combo is the worst strategy, but still better than relying on burst damage.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
