Pokemon|Description
:-:|:-
**Tyranitar** / Aggron|3 tap mega. Best effect for the competition, good for disruptions and combos
Pinsir / Charizard X (Shiny) / Rayquaza (Shiny) / Camerupt|2 tap mega. Good for disruptions and combos
Manectric / Ampharos|SE mega for beginners, the jagged line should make blocks more manageable
Mewtwo X (Shiny) / Gengar / Gyarados (Shiny)|Removes itself. Fast evolution and nice combo effectiveness, but can't handle blocks
Rayquaza|Removes 10 icons that are non-dragon types. Blocks hinder its viability

##Final notes

The preferred choice is of course a 3tapper, with Tyranitar being Neutral. If you lack one of them, fallback to 2 tapper. Grass and Electric megas are pretty weak, only begginers should use them. All purpose megas like Gengar and Rayquaza have big problems with blocks, so aren't suggested.

Water stages can be handled with double TC and Meganium is the perfect beatstick since the stage has blocks. Lacking both SE TC, you should rely on a neutral TC and other beatsticks, like Pikachu.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
