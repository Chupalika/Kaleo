##Competition basics

This is a **Psychic** type competition, so the Super Effective types that are highly recommended will be **Ghost**, Dark and Bug.

You have 8 (+5) moves to do the highest score you can. Take your time to do the best moves you can! For new players to competitions, it's worth it to do at least one full-item run for getting the Alakazite! Doing an itemless run to study disruptions is also suggested.

- Moves +5: Adds 5 moves to the stage
- Disruption Delay: Delays disruptions for half the duration of the stage
- Attack Power ↑: Attack power gets doubled
- **Complexity -1**: Removes your 4th Support Pokemon from play.

##Final notes

With Complexity-1, this is a 3 supports competition, results will be highly effected by RNG.

Self removal megas and tappers are great, the type effectiveness of the mega is totally marginal. Effect and Speed is miles better than the type alone.

If you don't have Mimikyu/Lunala or TC Hoopa (Unbound), you should probably use a full Sinister Power team. Shadow Dance is not as good as it seems, just like neutral TC. Bug strategy is even worse, but still greatly better than a burst skills.

Using Spookify+, could be better to skip Disruption Delay to maximize the damage in the first moves and save some coins.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
