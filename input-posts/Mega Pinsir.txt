##Final notes

The preferred choice is of course a 3tapper, with Tyranitar being SE. If you lack one of them, fallback to 2 tapper, otherwise use a SE one.

Ninetales Burn+ and Pyre are too deadly to even consider other options. You can have good scores both with a Typhlosion and a second Pyre, because both skills will trigger during beneficial disruptions. Neutral TC can be used if your Fire team is weak. Unity power and LDE are always an option for beginners.

Using Burn+, could be better to skip Disruption Delay to maximize the damage in the first moves and save some coins.

Rerun until you get a desirable score! **Good luck everyone!**
