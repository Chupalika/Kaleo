# Kaleo
PokÃ©mon Shuffle data parser, based off of [xJakub's parser](https://github.com/xJakub/ShuffleParser/) and named after [KaleoX](http://www.gamefaqs.com/community/KaleoX)

## Requirements
* The parser runs using Python 2.7. Using Python 3 will generate syntax errors...
* .bin files are needed for the parser to extract data from. [Chopra](https://github.com/bkimmett/Chopra) should output the files with the correct folders and file names. Just provide the folder names in the arguments. If it can't find a needed file, it'll output an error with the name.

## Usage
```python shuffleparser.py appdatafolder extdatafolder datatype index extraflag```

appdatafolder: The folder that holds data extracted from the app itself  
extdatafolder: The folder that holds data extracted from downloaded extra data (aka update data)  
datatype: The type of data to parse. Should be one of these values:  
* "stage"
* "expertstage"
* "eventstage"
* "layout"
* "expertlayout"
* "eventlayout"
* "pokemon"
* "ability"
* "escalationanger"
* "eventdetails"
* "escalationrewards"
* "eventstagerewards"
* "stagerewards"

index: Used for stage data, stage layouts, pokemon, and ability. Should be an integer or "all".  
extraflag: An extra flag. Can be any of these values:  
* "l" to enable layout image generation when parsing for stage layouts
* "m" to switch to mobile data parsing when parsing for stage data

Result is printed onto the console, it can be outputted to a file by adding "> output.txt" at the end of the command.

## Layout Image Generation
When retrieving data for stage layouts, use the extraflag "l" to enable layout image generation, which will create and save image files to the current directory. Things to note:
* At the moment, this feature requires a folder called "Icons" with png files of the Pokemon in it
* Python 32-bit can't generate more ~4 layouts in one sitting, it will crash with a Memory Error. Therefore, Python 64-bit is highly recommended.
* This feature requires OpenCV to be installed, follow steps 4-7 [here](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html#install-opencv-python-in-windows)
* This feature requires numpy to be installed, just execute command ```pip install numpy```

## 3DS vs Mobile
Most testing has been done with files extracted from a 3DS. Therefore it's assumed that provided files will be 3DS files. The Mobile files, for the most part, have the same format. One known discrepancy is the stage data. When parsing for stage data from Mobile files, use the extraflag "m" to set a flag which will parse a little differently. However, the locations of two values are unknown at the moment: base catch rate and background id.
